- Use the bslib package for styling and layout.

- Use the `meta` and `metafor` packages for meta-analysis. These packages provide functions for conducting meta-analysis, creating forest plots, funnel plots, and other relevant visualizations.

- For creating forest plots, use the `forest` function from the `meta` package or the `forest` function from the `metafor` package. Customize the plots to enhance readability and interpretability.

- For creating funnel plots, use the `funnel` function from the `meta` package or the `funnel` function from the `metafor` package. Customize the plots to enhance readability and interpretability.

- Handle missing values using the `naniar` package to identify missing data and the `mice` package for imputing missing values. Provide options for users to remove rows or columns with missing values if they prefer not to impute them.

- Implement data preprocessing steps such as data normalization, outlier detection, and data transformation to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for meta-analysis.
